Core Zetbox Development Environment
-----------------------------------
This chapter will describe how to contribute to zetbox basic. A Guide how to develop applications with zetbox will be covered in [[UsingZetBox]].

### Preparing a clean local build

First, it is necessary to have a clean build environment. Use *subst* to
create a drive *P:* where your checkout resides in a directory called
*Zetbox*.

The *!FullReset.cmd* will bring the database and the bootstrapping code
up to the current *Database.xml*’s content.

Now the environment is ready for programming.

### Merging local and remote changes

When the subversion repository has changed the *Database.xml* while
local changes were made to the schema, it is necessary to merge them
before comitting.

After fetching and merging the update from the subversion repository,
the local *Database.xml* has changes which are not yet in the database.
Running *!DeployAll.cmd* updadates the SQL-schema and produces a new set
of generated assemblies in the *CodeGenPath*. After testing that the
merge was successful, use *GetCodeGen.cmd* to update the working
directory with the newly generated bootstrapping code.

Now the working directory is ready for check in.
