msgid "Access Rights\n"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Managing access to objects has to be fine-grained, flexible, fast and "
"robust. To achieve these goals, the Zetbox combines an expressive set of "
"rules and generated rights tables."
msgstr ""

#. type: Title -
#, no-wrap
msgid "Roles\n"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"To decouple users from the specifics of access management, rights are only "
"conferred to roles, which in turn are assumed by users through their "
"membership in groups and relations."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"As an example, consider the project. The project’s manager will always have "
"special access rights on the project, regardless of who actually fills this "
"role. Formulating access rights relative to such roles makes them more "
"robust against changes in the people’s responsibilities, since when the "
"project manager changes all his rights automatically follow."

msgid "Groups"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"The easiest kind of role is the *Group*. Applicability of this role is only "
"defined through membership in the group and is independent of any other "
"relationships."
msgstr ""

#. type: Title ###
#, no-wrap
msgid "Instance-specific roles"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Instance-specific roles are conferred through specified relationships with "
"business objects. One example already mentioned is the project’s "
"*Manager*. Another the *assigned employees* for a project."
msgstr ""

#. type: Title ###
#, no-wrap
msgid "Transitive roles"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"In some cases the role is not directly associated with the business object "
"under consideration. Instead the connection spans over one or more "
"navigational properties. An example would be access to the set of *Tasks* "
"contained in a project, which is granted by virtue of being an assigned "
"employee of the project."
msgstr ""

#. type: Title ###
#, no-wrap
msgid "Nested roles"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Finally, roles can be members of groups or roles. This allows for the "
"definition of groups like *all project managers*, which for example might be "
"granted rights on a special set of documents pertaining to management "
"procedures."
msgstr ""

#. type: Title -
#, no-wrap
msgid "Rules\n"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Rules are the way to specify how rights are assigned to roles. There are "
"global, *ObjectClass*-specific and instance-specific rules."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Global rules can be used for granting blanket administrative access or for "
"privileged transfer or analysis processes."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"ObjectClass-specific rules are useful for defining class-specific "
"administrators, journalling classes (insert only) and other special cases."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Finally, instance-specific rules allow the most flexible and fine-grained "
"access control, by defining cascading rights through various mechanisms. All "
"such rules specify the set of roles for which the rule is applicable, the "
"set of instances which are affected by this rule and the set of granted "
"rights."
msgstr ""

#. type: Title ###
#, no-wrap
msgid "Instance-specific rules"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"First, an example: all employees assigned to a project are allowed to edit "
"the associated tasks of the project. As an instance-specific rule, this "
"would read: \"*Project*: Grant READ,WRITE on *Tasks* to *Employees*.\""
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"The set of roles can be specified by a navigator from the current instance "
"to a single Identity or a set of Identities, by a constant set of groups or "
"as a set of necessary access rights to the current instance."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"The set of affected instances can be specified by a direct navigator from "
"the current instance, or by using the instance itself."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"The rules themselves are defined on the ObjectClass and are then evaluated "
"for each instance."

msgid "Implementation\n"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"The goal of the implementation is minimal overhead when reading data from "
"the store while providing maintainable and discoverable structures in the "
"underlying database. To achieve this goal, the rules and roles are "
"recursively evaluated until only bare identity-instance pairs with the "
"appropriate access rights remain. This data is subsequently stored in an "
"auxilliary table to each data table. When selecting data from the primary "
"table, an inner join with the access table only returns those instances that "
"have any granted rights at all. Additional filtering can either take place "
"on the SQL level or by passing the access flags through a read-only property "
"to the business logic."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"The access tables are implemented as materialized views of table-valued "
"functions. See \\cite{MatViewsWork} for implementation details. Due to the "
"structured source of the data all necessary functions, update functions and "
"triggers can be generated together with the schema."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
msgid ""
"Depending on the specific implementation needs the recursive evaluation can "
"take place when instances are changed, when the user first tries to access "
"the instance, or off-line as a maintenance task."

"Here is an extended example, containing two *Projects* and a few people "
"working on them. Every Project has some *Tasks* and working time is recorded "
"in *TimeRecords*."
